These test cases are not intended as regression tests, or anything as fancy as that.

They each provide an example of use of specific features of stylesheets or schemas,
and a short description of what is tested and what result is expected. The result
is the control flow and summary graphs, intended to be inspected manually (dump all
relevant structures as .dot, and transform to ps with graphviz, or inspect summary
and control flow graph xml).

The output schemas specified are NOT tailored for the test, and probably even do not
exist. It makes no sense to take the processing of these tests beyond summary graph
construction (although regression test with validation and all sure would be nice).

In many of the test cases, the stylesheet is the general identity transform. The
expected result is then a summary graph conservatively approximating the input schema.
