<notes>
This example demonstrates the validatorÂ´s ability to work with full 
<em>single-type</em> regular tree languages (XML Schema), in addition to the
smaller family of <em>local</em> regular tree languages (DTD). For example, 
there are two different declarations of elements named <tt>customer</tt>,
and they are distinguished in the analysis.
<br/>
Some quite accurate string analysis features are also demonstrated:
The validator can distinguish between different XML Schema <tt>SingleType</tt>s,
even where text nodes are context types.
<br/>
The transform has no errors.
