  <notes>
Some spurious errors are caused by an inaccurate approximation 
of several selections on the form <tt>//node</tt> in the stylesheet.
<br/>
For example, there is a complaint the the output <tt>{invoice}Invoice</tt>
element may have an empty content model - in fact, there will always
be some output. One real error, that too <em>many</em> <tt>Entry</tt>
elements may be output, is masked by the spurious error.
<br/>
The easiest way to get a more accurate analysis would be to provide
better input: The <tt>//</tt> selections in the stylesheet are in
fact not necessary, and can replaced by selections relative to the
context node. This might also perform better at run-time. After this 
clean-up is done on the stylesheet (try!), the validator will reveal
the single real error.
